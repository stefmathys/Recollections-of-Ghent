# Recollections-of-Ghent
Open-source project documentation of an industrial design master's thesis at Ghent University. The project seeks to develop an interactive, intuitive and inclusive phygital (physical + digital) product to bridge the gap between the collections of museums and the memories of older persons, and is made in collaboration with the larger project Collections of Ghent, an open-source project by the city of Ghent to look into mobilisation of cultural heritage using tools for digitalisation. More information on this project can be found on their website: https://www.collections.gent/ or their developer GitHub documentation: https://coghent.github.io/ .

This documentation will be updated during June 2023 as a final deliverable on top of the thesis text and the public thesis defense seminar.
